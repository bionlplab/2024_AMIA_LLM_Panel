  <h2>Overview</h2>
    <div class="overview">
    <p>The panel explores the transformative impact of Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT in biomedicine and
health informatics, reflecting on the rapid advancements and broad applications of generative AI. The panel will
start with an explanation of the rationale behind developing a special issue in JAMIA focused on LLMs and its peer-
review process. This will be followed by a structured overview of those accepted papers, as well as aggregated
statistics of all submissions. By focusing on innovative methodologies, challenges, and opportunities for future
integration into healthcare systems, the panel aims to provide a comprehensive and timely overview of the current
landscape and trends in LLM research within biomedicine. Through interactive dialogue with the attendees, the
session seeks to illuminate ways to advance healthcare through the responsible application of LLMs, addressing
educational needs, evaluation methods, and the integration of domain knowledge to refine these powerful tools.</p>

  <h2>About the speakers</h2>
    <div class="schedule">
        <p><b>Zhiyong Lu</b>, Ph.D., FACMI, is a tenured Senior Investigator of the NIH Intramural Research Program, leading
research in biomedical text and image processing, information retrieval, and AI/machine learning. In his role as
Deputy Director for Literature Search at the National Center of Biotechnology Information (NCBI), Dr. Lu oversees
the overall R&D efforts to improve literature search and information access in resources like PubMed and LitCovid
that are used by millions worldwide daily. Additionally, Dr. Lu holds an Adjunct Professor position with the
Department of Computer Science at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). In this panel, Dr. Lu will
introduce the state of the special issue and the panelists. He will serve as the moderator of this panel.

        <p><b>Suzanne Bakken</b>, RN, PhD, FAAN, FACMI, is the Alumni Professor of Nursing and Professor of Biomedical Informatics at Columbia University. Following doctoral study in nursing at the University of California, San Francisco, she completed a National Library of Medicine postdoctoral fellowship in Medical Informatics at Stanford University. The goal of Dr. Bakken’s program of research is to promote health and reduce health disparities in underserved populations through application of innovative informatics methods. A major focus of her current grant portfolio is visualization of healthcare data for community members, patients, clinicians, and community-based organizations. Dr. Bakken was the 2019 recipient of the IMIA François Grémy Award of Excellence, which was awarded at MedInfo. She was the first nurse and 10th recipient of the prestigious honor.</p>

        <p><b>Trevor A. Cohen</b>, MBChB, Ph.D., FACMI is a Professor of Biomedical Informatics and Medical Education and an
Adjunct Professor of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at the University of Washington, Seattle. Prior to his research
career, he trained and practiced as a physician with a clinical interest in mental health. His research focuses on
computational models of language and their biomedical applications, with application areas including literature-based
discovery, post-marketing surveillance, plain language summarization, and detection of linguistic indicators of
psychiatric and neurological conditions. Dr. Cohen is also an editor of a recent textbook on AI in medicine. Drawing
on examples from the special issue, Dr. Cohen will discuss the mechanisms through which LLMs generate text
, and how they present unique risks and opportunities for their application to support clinical care.

        <p><b>Marzyeh Ghassemi</b>, Ph.D., is an Associate Professor at MIT in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science
(EECS) and Institute for Medical Engineering & Science (IMES), and a Vector Institute faculty member holding a
Canadian CIFAR AI Chair and Canada Research Chair. Professor Ghassemi holds a Herman L. F. von Helmholtz
Career Development Professorship and was named a CIFAR Azrieli Global Scholar and one of MIT Tech Review’s
35 Innovators Under 35. Prior to her PhD in Computer Science at MIT, she received an MSc. degree in biomedical
engineering from Oxford University as a Marshall Scholar, and B.S. degrees in computer science and electrical
engineering as a Goldwater Scholar at New Mexico State University. Drawing on examples from the special issue,
Dr. Ghassemi will discuss the biases that enter generative models in health.
        </p>

<!--         <p><b>Chunhua Weng</b>, PhD, FACMI, is a Professor of Biomedical Informatics at Columbia University. Her long-time
research focus is clinical research informatics using scalable knowledge engineering methods. She is also an
Associate Editor for Journal Biomedical Informatics. She has published extensively on the representativeness of
clinical trial study populations, clinical phenotyping using messy EHR data, and knowledge-guided and data-centric
Augmented Intelligence interventions to support the life cycle of clinical evidence. Drawing on examples from the
special issue, Dr. Weng will discuss the tradeoffs of using LLMs to augment humans in various healthcare
applications.
